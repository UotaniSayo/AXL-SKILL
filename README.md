# AXL-SKILL

My SKILL programs repository for Cadence Allegro.


# BRIEF INTRO

The Cadence SKILL is used to customize your design environment of Cadence Allegro, it is based on Lisp and supports a more conventional C-like syntax.

For more infomation, just refer to _sklanguser.pdf_ by Cadence.


# ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY

Every program here is supposed to achieve certain function, or play as a module. None of them are interdependent. In addition, programs here are written for universal use, namely that (generally) they won't be restricted by specific design rules, criteria, etc.

And please note that some programs remain incompleted, because I'm lazy.
